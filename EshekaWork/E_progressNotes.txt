4/8 notes
Used https://vectorbyteorg.github.io/vectorbyte-training2024/VB_TimeSeriesForecastingPractical.html#partitioning-the-data
to make the forecast.

Truncated the last 30 days of data, trained the model, and then tested the 30 day forecast. Got these accuracy values:
  model      RMSE       MAE
1   stl 0.6082935 0.4816213

Relatively average values, but can be way better.
Next thing to do is add regressors.
