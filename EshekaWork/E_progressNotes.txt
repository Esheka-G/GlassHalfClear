4/8 notes
Used https://vectorbyteorg.github.io/vectorbyte-training2024/VB_TimeSeriesForecastingPractical.html#partitioning-the-data
to make the forecast.

Truncated the last 30 days of data, trained the model, and then tested the 30 day forecast. Got these accuracy values:
  model      RMSE       MAE
1   stl 0.6082935 0.4816213

Relatively average values, but can be way better.
Next thing to do is add regressors.

Another thing to check is the dates

forecast dataset
meteorology data
smoothing.R OR keeporiginaldata.R
smoothpredvsactual
updatingdata.R
